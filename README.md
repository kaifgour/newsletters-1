# Newsletter Templates

Choose a newsletter template below, view and copy the source, then edit it locally in Sublime/etc before pasting into MailChimp.

* If you comment code, make sure to remove it before pasting in MailChimp. Some mail clients will show the commented code, which could be very embarrassing.
* Images should be added as *CMS Assets.*
* If you're adding or removing the same code from a template week after week, let Jeremy know so he can update the master template, and save you some time.
